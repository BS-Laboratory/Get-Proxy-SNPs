# Update List 
#### 04/12/63 : 17.30-20.30 (3 hours) <br>
- [x] Check SNPs in summary statistic on GSA array. <br>
- [x] Get the proxy SNPs by using LDlink pacakge with East Asian as reference background. <br>
- [x] Get Proxy SNPs of 313 SNPS and reported those are monoallelic and not SNPs. <br>
- [x] Many proxy SNPs are found but are not select the final ones yets.<br>

#### 05/12/63 : 16.30-17.30,01.30-02.00 (1.5 hours)  <br>
- [x] Explore proxy SNPs by using three references (SAS,EAS,and EAS+SAS). <br>

#### 07/12/63 : 8.30-11.30,20.00-22.00 (5 hours)  <br>
- [x] create pipeline
![image](workflow.png)
- [x] summarize data 
![image](GSA_array_check.png)
- [x] Get the optimal proxy SNPs but some of them still have candidate (same dprim, same regulomedb, and same MAF)
(file saved as result/proxy_SNPs_EAS_SAS.csv)
